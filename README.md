# 2022-oop-examples

Here are a few of the hundreds of topics I've been ingesting this year. I chose not to get bogged down with forking, pushing, or handling change management within git at the moment, to focus on core objectives. Gitlab is a great tool and dashboard worth taking the time to re-learn, but chances are a team already has their needs well in place and I can shift towards whatever works best for them. This is here just to give you a heads up of just a fraction of what I'm capable of. 

I ran across [ArjancCodes](https://www.arjancodes.com) recently and have found many of his tutorials directly relatable to projects I have worked on in the past.
