I ran across a great resource- [ArjancCodes](https://www.arjancodes.com) recently- and have found many of his tutorials directly relatable to projects I have worked on in the past, and so I wanted to give credit where due. 

I'm sure someone will mention the right way to fork a repo. I'm not trying to steal anyones hard work. It takes hard work just to understand how to step up code writing skills to the next level- and that is how to refactor code efficiently and quickly for maintainability and longevity.  

I like to add my own additional notes to be able to go back and relate what they said- as far as what is well understood and where potential blockers might lay when coming back to actual R&D or implementation details later in time. Sometimes this is in days, weeks, or even months. People can only hold so much information in short term memory.

So in here are a few of the hundreds of topics I've been ingesting this year. I chose not to get bogged down with forking, pushing, caching, or handling change management within git at the moment, to focus on core objectives. However, there are security implications with simply uploading work without understanding what it encompasses. 

Take for instance a new workflow involving ipython notebooks and VScode I'm working on. A kernel executes cell information and outputs them into the file, which might offer more information than we wish in public. 

This information may be embedded in files without really knowing all thats there that is part of the several Jupyter Extensions for VScode, or where caching takes place for rendering. Having a larger team that handles specifics such as this allows single developers to focus on business objectives, and mine currently is to educate people on my current skillsets without having to have a face to face conversation.

Gitlab is a great tool with a dashboard worth taking the time to re-learn, but chances are a team already has their needs well in place and I can shift towards whatever works best for them. This is here just to give you a heads up of just a fraction of what I'm working on.
